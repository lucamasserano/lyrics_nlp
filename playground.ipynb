Bring light to the situation. Maybe, you know, try to find your own personal message in that incident, that experience, and try to move forward…   Y'all got me? Everything good? Y'all can hear me? Before we start, let me just say this, let me just say this I'm datin' you, Day… wait, wait, pause, no gay shit What's the difference between a date and a day anyway, Day? A date is a day that's marked I'm smart, and just ‘cause I know you love 'em so much I came with name flips for days, tailored just for Day I'm expecting Day to base his verse on data based on turds My database said Day the basehead that date a basehead Is he dope? No. Who gave Day the base? Ball is what we do best Flock his projects; that's a home run Day, the baseball is what we do best Carpe diem, that's how you say \"seize the day\" in French I stand behind these bars for the rest of my life I will never see the light of Day again Now witnessing this rare occasion I bear fruits of my labor, this Grape is green I gotta eat on the go, Day I hope they told you that everything that Soul say don't go a long way—don't go a long way, what? A ho in Chipotle, no, this is food for thought From a dog on top We been nuts, there was a fool who thought we was new to this, but who knew this would end up A glow stick in a uterus; that's Lyt in a box And that's light, that's light But Lyt like to lick twat a lot, so that's right That's what y'all call street? No tales from the Crip this evenin' He slip, seems he forgot what the C meant It's your dumbass' fault that last part was so concrete But I guess you'd have to be kin to get that bar, b Pardon me, I bet right about now You feelin' like Jordan down in the Jordan Downs In fact it's crazy that you even play ball To clear your thoughts before raw backwards And that's cool, but for this round, save the bull Before you let the Jordan Downs and Jordan down Now, as for the crew Well, uhh, the villain been itchin' to skin a dog And this nigga bought What, a hundred and three dalmatians? It's safe to say your mob of dots won't make it And I'm a fan first, but it won't take too many seconds To leave you in a damn urn You deserve this disservice I put this man in ER's if he don't got no manners Man, word, I'm expectin' Some etiquette in your segment, kid I brought you to the 'Stu to show how we do So all them antics and funny shit you do for the cameras don't get aired here, they can't see you Wave your title to this tidal wave, we do And you don't appear to be a peer to me For real, you should kneel to me or somethin' Fuck it, to keep it hundred, you're nil to me, that's nothin' Heard they been raisin' raisins down on Grape Street That's crazy, right? That's what happens when you expose them Grapes to too much Daylyt So your chances of standin' Much smaller than my plan to defeat you Wait, what, do I gotta put it in photosynthesis or somethin', son? Shed some light on Day? 'Til he's cropped out No, not now, I won't need a plant to defeat you The sequel, this movie, won't need to be continued You finally encountered somethin' you can't counter Coward, you're counterfeit You ain't gotta be in a Walgreen's pharmacy To see Quill drug over the counter After your mother consumed you You were the fruit of the womb After you were born, I'm sure you wore Fruit of the Loom Now I'm tryna figure out, is you from Grape Street, Crip Or just another fruit in this room? It's crucial, you choose I'm sure you don't want me to assume I should be against the law to run into ‘Cause we all know in L.A. I'm double you All so true, today is the day I split Day in two What the fuck has battle rap turned Day into? Are you from Gotham or from Watts? Are you Batman, Spawn, or Devone? Did you really think \"Paul Walker\" was a dope song? If so, you were wrong But hold on, I got one more, and don't lie to me Do you really have a Batmobile outside, my G? Don't be so transparent, this nigga Lyt through If you don't know what transparent means Let me enlighten you If it's transparent, that means that it lets the light through So I should smack this trans' parents for lettin' Lyt through Like, the nerve of this cat Lyin' with a motionless emotion, this nigga Day all bitch Somebody get Quill a quilt before Quill get killed Do Quill got skill at all, homie? It was some Braveheart shit; all I heard was nah's, homie Did you really expect to last, Day? You know Revelations say that we livin' in the last days I mean, I see you skimmed through Genesis and Timothy But did you get to that page? You got gats? You think your little arm'll get in the way of Armageddon? Forget it, Day! No, really, forget this day If I had a time machine, I'd go back in time to see Just how many people would say yes to Day Nobody, fam, nobody, fam, that's why I'm ahead to Day No, no body, fam, that's why I'm a head today No, nobody fam, that's why I'm ahead of Day Somebody check the clock, I think I'm ahead a day Send him to the choppin' block, off with the head of Day It's only right I be blunt to Lyt I only gave Lyt a match to light a blunt I see I should have used the lighter instead Chill, Loc, we ain't smokin' no purple We need the fire instead When I think of daylight, I think of shit like… breakfast, morning, birds singin', kids playin'—see where I'm goin'? That means you better break fast Or I'll have your family mourning' When that bird sings, kid, I ain't playin' and you know it But you know what? Hold on, hold on Let me get you right, we have this shit Take this 500 before you clap this shit up Say this, let me say this, let me just say this These flashin' lights got Lyt flashin', nigga, for the glory Your buzz lightyears from here Quill, and you tellin' toy stories You boys bore me, that's why I'm hoggin' all lanes All your bars Häagen-Dazs, that's on everything Day a dairy queen, Deluxe; bless, King! Dearly beloved, all first verse, all first verse You know I brought a hearst For the sausage you brought worst Dearly beloved, here lies this little light of mine That tried to let it shine And I hate that we have to hear lies From this little light of mine that tried to let it shine But I'm ill, you men ate when I finished Lyt You get it, Lyt? That's how you ILL-u-min-ate And finish Lyt, good night Hold on, hold on, hold on Let me get you right, you got that for me? Brought you some complimentary TDE ski masks   Question, you know how many copies The Matrix sold? It don't matter, The Matrix's old I double cats, I ask 'em if they seen the glitch No, no, no, face it, I got it covered Prevail, they say the sail was a thread to hell The gravitational stitch, ‘cause some niggas seem down They come up with this perfectly clean round But I hope you not doin' this cause of fear Of the pen, I'ma prove you pussy within But I guess it's up to you to risk your career I retire niggas, I'm the slow leak crew I could OD too, and even the odds some He thought he could least get a baby victory But all he got was \"Nah, son.\" Check this out, he not ready Either you fight back or I Ether you Thought you could face what I hand you Well, this is isn't peek-a-boo Soon as I took a peek at you, you looked shocked Peep it, you put everything at stake Well done, this is beef, right? Jesus, holy cow, cut the bull, Soul, before you get meatsliced I'm from the third, I gotta try you Guy, you play Ryu, lose a ken in a street fight Nice slow guidance with both sirens You still couldn't see Lyt Division, I got it covered, I'm so eye lit Pilot, fly, I be the goblin; we battle for a stack In fact they had to get a cataract, ‘cause I be the problem But it's useless, use less filler, excuse the excuses But, but, but… these asscheek niggas dead You said you would fry Day previously But that's what the last weak nigga said But, but, but keep cool, Joe, ‘cause dog crazy Get down, we turn niggas vegetable if they don't let us up He know the heat blowers like Daffy at the casino Nigga, you better duck But I tell them tails we never tuck, we gon' line that ass up I from the Watts block for decision My profession is stompin' squares the fuck out We played hopscotch for a livin' But that's def, that's just plain old def It's funny how we're all in here but bro don't listen Have a seat, pick chairs Picture this photo, this a Soulo, is it?

Common roll the physics, so exquisite Thought I was in here dolo No, bro, somebody tell Soulo this not a solo mission The deal closed, SoHo is it Thought you could fuck with me, gal? I gotta Cotto-split him Look at your girl dead in her eyes And say \"Fuck Dorothy, dog!\"; I'm toto dissin' But at this moment, everybody in the room should be scared as hell, as I release bars, they better bail Objects that I process is parallel Let's get this aligned, minus sinus The stuff he knows flew overhead, it's cold, redemption Stay still, as I apply DayQuil, ‘cause you look like you need medical attention, don't mind me See where mind be is a mine, explosive, interior is inferior This is a hobby probly, y'all see I got the drop on everybody That's why I reign superior Whether you like or not, it's Hell for you, ice plate These blister niggas still can't overshadow a nice Day Remember, you did say you would fry Day? But you don't realize you're on the weak end to the streets Preacher for they peeps, you asshole You in the motion to grab toes, you're reachin' for defeat I tell 'em I got the four in Cut the sheep, it's all for the woolish Game I play is death, get sword for the hoodish Actin', it's Tinactin, it's all for the footage I'm dope, I'm practical, crack to you I need a lot of space; the galactic crew, the actors knew You feel it it's Felix, see what the old cat could do But you got the roots stirred up, gelatin dropped and slide This game is stormchasin' Based on whether you got the drive Win rounds, destroy their whole city—will they get tore? Nay, do you realize I still got a break, brother?

And I told you once, I gotta give 'em the Quill And I gotta give 'em the skill I be on my tip, like I tried to give him the bill New approach, Bull coach; I tried to give 'em the feel For Watts, starvin', gotta get us a meal Bein' modest, this is modern astrology for the real You can't back up defeat, but I try to get up the hill Cold, rack up the heat, but I'm tired of niggas that grill Chicago in my blood, but I used to be the shyest Cat form, but now I'm back searchin' for the highest Platform, see where I come from? It was sirens, blackboards Eyelids see the violence, what is that for? .44 shoot, they screamin', \"Who's that guy?!\" Jesus, his face, they screamin', \"Who's that?! God!\" We be on the top, careers gettin' too high They knew I would get a million dollars, what I do buy That pink kid in the cup, that Majin Buu fly Tragic, twin maggots; I grew up too fly They askin', \"Who I?\" in front of that triangle black That's that guy that come with the side kangol hat We take it back from slangin' packs to the stars mission Older now, I'm in the Rover, but it's not a Mars mission Settle down, one child, merry; feel like I'm Marge pimpin' Bitches wanna eat my shorts; feel like I'm Bart Simpson I feel this a full moon, chocolate, dreams puddin' They be likin' everything I do, they're teen wolfin' But you got it, you got it bad 2Pac, don't watch the world sad, come back Two watches, that's pocket change Dude coppin' that clock exchange Credit good, I'ma pull the card out Better be hyesterectomy, show 'em how to ball out Cough, they can show that they're stomach so they fall out Whip, double roof, dog barkin' in the dog house And I gotta give 'em the light My people in the struggle, I gotta give 'em a fight Ain't no equal piece of puzzle, hope God'll give us the mic Ain't no sequel to this puzzle, I gotta give us the life Wow, they say the Bugatti went up in price Wow, that's a million, I'm done   Ces jours-ci, je suis très concentré\r"
