    "In order not to negatively influence the analysis of the lyrics, it's important to drop those instances which show lengths that are completely unrealistic given the type of the data. A quick inspection reveals that for some unspecified reason the *Genius* API I used has a few nonsensical instances, such as lyrics long up to 150000 tokens, or as short as 20 tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "I found a good rule of thumb by plotting the length distribution (the plot on the left serves as proof that there is at least one lyrics that is incredibly long, since the axis stops at 150000). Assuming that an average lyrics line contains at least 5 to 10 words, I dropped all instances with `len < 30`, i.e. approximately less than 3 to 6 lines. As for the upper bound I dropped all lyrics with more than 2000 tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the above only aims at dropping instances which are clearly not lyrics and at homogenizing data, I decided to do it directly on the raw dataset, without a preliminary deletion of punctuation. "

    "As an example of the result, Yusuf Islam (previously known as Cat Stevens) has been musically active (publising albums) under this name from 1995 to 2017. Indeed, after he became muslim in 1977 he changed his name and stopped performing since 1980. The last cell of this section shows the labels obtained with the method described above, which are perfectly coherent with the musical activity of this artist."
