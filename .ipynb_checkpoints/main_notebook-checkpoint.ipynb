The first few sections (retrieval, cleaning, annotation) have been coded as a script due to the nature of the tasks, while for the core of the analysis I tried to build everything with classes and functions which make the code very easy to use and flexible. In this sense, some parameters are sometimes not explicitly exposed in method/function calls because they have default values, which can nonetheless be easily seen in the relevant definitions within the class.\n",

For each letter, *MetroLyrics* provides a page of ~50 most popular artists across every musical genre and period, from 50 Cent, Arctic Monkeys and Shakira, to Bruce Springsteen, Billie Holiday and B.B King. Each artist has in turn a whole page of popular songs, usually from ~20 to ~80. \n",

Where the Hip-Hop culture signals itself with links to the African American culture ('nigga') and with a more frequent use of bad words, genres like Jazz point us to the emotional sphere perhaps also in a metaphoric way ('dream'). Finally, words like 'die' and 'world' appear in the top 20 only in the Metal genre."
